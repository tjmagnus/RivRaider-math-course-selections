  "body": " Guide to Selecting Courses   Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  As you were directed to this document, a course was probably recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical background. If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left to explore other options recommended for your major. If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement Survey, you should return to the survey after making your selection to record your decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.    Learning Outcomes and Readiness  As you explore this document, you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems yet. On the other hand, if you can do them all, you will likely become bored and unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you will find that you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.  Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about all students and are happy to help students outside of class, they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University offers a single course, for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills before enrolling in their general-education math course. Students who question their ability to perform these skills are encouraged to use the problems in to self-assess their readiness for further coursework.    Recommended Mathematics Courses  Students majoring in education will want to consider how their choice of a mathematics course can give them deeper understanding into the mathematics that they will be teaching and prepare them to pass the required licensure exams for educational certification. In addition, some mathematics courses encourage communication skills and creative and logical thinking all of which will enhance your teaching. One course, has been designed to meet the needs of elementary and early childhood education majors. It covers and delves deeper into the geometry concepts taught in the K-8 setting while encouraging curiosity and discovery. In addition, education majors may choose mathematics as their area of specialization. To complete this specialization, six courses in mathematics, normally MA110 Introductory Statistics, , , MA165 Calculus I, a course above 200, and one additional course like . Highly-prepared students may request permission to take higher-level alternatives. Each of these courses encourage the development of mathematical practices as well as content knowledge. The table below gives an indication of what is emphasized in each mathematics course.

Other options include MA123 Quantitative Literacy , and MA130 Functions .  In MA126, the focus is on mathematical thinking and open-ended problem solving. Creativity and logic will serve you well as you explore some of the big ideas of mathematics. A good foundation in high school algebra and geometry is all you need. You will solve logic puzzles, observe number patterns, appreciate the importance of number theory in our digital world, learn what makes rational numbers so different from irrationals, question whether there might be more than one size of infinity, compute probabilities, stumble upon paradoxes, and be introduced to some conjectures that have not yet been proved to be true (or false)! If you enjoy puzzles and games and figuring stuff out, this may be the class for you.  The content of MA126 may vary, but some of the questions below are often explored:   If I could fold a paper in half 50 times, how high would it be?    Continue the sequence . What do we notice about the ratios ?    Why must there be an infinite number of primes? What role do prime numbers play in our digital world?    Is a rational number? How do I write as a fraction?   What is the missing digit in the UPC code X?   Whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers: Are these sets of numbers the same size or are there different sizes of infinity?    What is the probability that two people in the class share a birthday?    How can I use logic and mathematics to ensure that I will win a two-player game? Does it matter whether I play first or second?     To be successful in MA126, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, converting between units, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be willing to read word problems and develop strategies to solve them. Some algebraic topics such as prime factorization, long division, and the quadratic equation will be reviewed briefly when introduced in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a \"can-do\" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas and test out strategies with others.

  "body": " MA127 Geometrical Explorations   MA127 is an exploratory, tactile course in which students observe geometric relationships, make conjectures, and test them. Topics include construction and measurement of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures, tilings, transformations, regularity, congruence and similarity, and impossibility. Students practice thinking outside the box, exploring why geometrical formulas work, and making arguments that use diagrams and words. The topics are chosen to help Education majors prepare for the Praxis and similar licensure exams, but students of all majors are welcome to develop their tactile, visual, and verbal reasoning skills, to strengthen their geometrical understanding, and to make clear logic arguments. If you like building things and making art, this might be a good fit for you.    What will I explore in MA127?  Topics covered may vary, but often includes the following:   Determine the formula for the area of a trapezoid by cutting it up into rectangles, triangles, and\/or parallelograms.    Explain why the Pythagorean theorem holds by rearranging triangles and squares into other shapes.    Create tilings and quilt patterns and discover which regular polygons can be used to make symmetric designs.    Build three-dimensional solids with polygonal faces and explore the possibilities and patterns.    Determine which logos have reflective and rotational symmetry and discover the relationships between the angle of rotation and the number of reflecting lines.    Discover what happens when you reflect a figure across two lines in succession. When is it a rotation? A translation?    What number patterns arise from the study of star polygons, kaleidoscopes, billiard ball paths, and fractals?    What happens to familiar geometrical properties when you create shapes on a sphere instead of a flat surface? Do they still hold? Are there other geometries other that Euclidean geometry?       Am I ready for MA127?  To be successful in MA127, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, working with exponents and square roots, plotting points on a graph, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be able to follow the steps in a task and think outside the box. Good writing skills will help as you learn how to develop clear explanations and incorporate visuals and symbolic expressions. Some fundamental topics such as computing areas and perimeters, using the Pythagorean Theorem, and the simplifying square roots will be reviewed briefly at the appropriate time in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a \"can-do\" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas with others, to notice patterns, and to give explanations.

  "title": "MA130 Functions",
  "body": " MA130 Functions   MA130 gives students the preparation they need to succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge of algebraic and transcendental functions to other fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view.    Topics in MA130 Functions  Topics include sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.  This course is not available for credit to students who have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus course in high school which focused primarily on computations with little attention to theory and applications may benefit from MA130.  The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112 College Algebra, a course recommended only for students who plan also to take MA130 Functions. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation.   What will I learn in MA130 Functions?   At the end of MA130, you should be able to do the following. You do not need to be able to do these problems at the beginning of the course. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions will be introduced in MA130, but students should already have a strong grasp of linear functions and the ability to simplify expressions involving polynomials, radicals, and exponents.

Some students need to reinforce their algebraic skills and understanding to prepare for success in MA130. If you are able to do most of the problems in the next set on your own, then you should do well in MA130. If your degree and career plan includes a need for Functions or Calculus and you struggle with most of these prerequisite problems, then you may want to start in MA112. If you do not plan on taking MA130 later, we recommend that you choose one of the other options accessible from the left sidebar.     Choosing Your Course  MA130 is the right course for you if you are strong in algebra techniques (see for comparison) but find many of the problems in to be new or difficult. In MA130, there will also be an emphasis on doing problems that are closer to how you encounter mathematics beyond the classroom; your ability to take a mathematical situation and rephrase it into a formula will grow. On the other hand, if you are comfortable completing most of the above problems on your own with only minor errors, then you may be ready to enroll in MA165 Calculus or a higher-level course . Talk to your advisor and\/or the mathematics program director to help you determine the right course for you. Credit for Advanced Placement exams will be considered once scores are received.

As soon as you have your scores or transcripts, contact your academic advisor . Advisors will assist you in receiving credit where appropriate and adjusting your fall schedule.    What if I change my mind about my math course or realize during the first week of the semester that I am in the wrong course?   Students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor at any time before the add\/drop deadline, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered the add\/drop period. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Contact your academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges, so you are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the start of the semester. If you are considering switching your math class during the first week of classes, you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in their course. You will be expected to make up any work in your added classes that you may have missed during the transition.  The add\/drop deadline is posted on the Rivier academic calendar .    What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher course?   If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112 to take a subsequent course, you are welcome to study mathematics over the remainder of the summer with the intention of enrolling in a higher course. There are many online algebra resources available on the web. You are encouraged to consult the course textbook as well.  If you improve your mathematics skills and wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your academic advisor after you have studied the material. Since students often find that the summer flies by quicker than anticipated and that learning on their own is challenging, we ask that you select a mathematics course based on where you are now, and then request a schedule change if summer study makes a difference. On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select the higher course now.    "

  "body": " What if I change my mind about my math course or realize during the first week of the semester that I am in the wrong course?   Students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor at any time before the add\/drop deadline, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered the add\/drop period. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Contact your academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges, so you are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the start of the semester. If you are considering switching your math class during the first week of classes, you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in their course. You will be expected to make up any work in your added classes that you may have missed during the transition.  The add\/drop deadline is posted on the Rivier academic calendar .  "

  "body": " What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher course?   If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112 to take a subsequent course, you are welcome to study mathematics over the remainder of the summer with the intention of enrolling in a higher course. There are many online algebra resources available on the web. You are encouraged to consult the course textbook as well.  If you improve your mathematics skills and wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your academic advisor after you have studied the material. Since students often find that the summer flies by quicker than anticipated and that learning on their own is challenging, we ask that you select a mathematics course based on where you are now, and then request a schedule change if summer study makes a difference. On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select the higher course now.  "
