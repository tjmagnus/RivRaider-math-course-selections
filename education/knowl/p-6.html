<div class="para">Students majoring in education will want to consider how their choice of a mathematics course can give them deeper understanding into the mathematics that they will be teaching and prepare them to pass the required licensure exams for educational certification. In addition, some mathematics courses encourage communication skills and creative and logical thinking all of which will enhance your teaching. One course, <a href="ch-GeoEx.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA127 Geometrical Explorations">MA127 Geometrical Explorations</a> has been designed to meet the needs of elementary and early childhood education majors. It covers and delves deeper into the geometry concepts taught in the K-8 setting while encouraging curiosity and discovery. In addition, education majors may choose mathematics as their area of specialization. To complete this specialization, six courses in mathematics, normally MA110 Introductory Statistics, <a href="ch-GeoEx.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA127 Geometrical Explorations">MA127 Geometrical Explorations</a>, <a href="ch-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: MA130 Functions">MA130 Functions</a>, MA165 Calculus I, a course above 200, and one additional course like <a href="ch-Puzzles.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability">MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability</a>. Highly-prepared students may request permission to take higher-level alternatives. Each of these courses encourage the development of mathematical practices as well as content knowledge. The table below gives an indication of what is emphasized in each mathematics course.</div>
