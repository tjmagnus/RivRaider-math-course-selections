<div class="para">We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem to be a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. Otherwise, consider the following: As an Education Major, you should first determine whether you need <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> since that course will help prepare you for your Core Math course, some education courses, and your licensure exams. Taking <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> is a benefit to the students who really need it, but many students are ready to complete their core math requirement. Education majors who can do most of the skills in <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> should consider whether they would benefit from <a href="ch-GeoEx.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA127 Geometrical Explorations">MA127 Geometrical Explorations</a> which delves deeper into the geometry needed for K-8 teaching and tested on the licensure exam. <a href="ch-GeoEx.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA127 Geometrical Explorations">MA127 Geometrical Explorations</a> is only offered in the spring semester so Education majors choosing mathematics as their specialization may opt to take <a href="ch-Puzzles.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability">MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability</a> or <a href="ch-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: MA130 Functions">MA130 Functions</a> in their first semester.</div>
