            As soon as you have your scores or transcripts, 
            contact your <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu"

                What if I change my mind about my math course 
                or realize during the first week of the semester  
                that I am in the wrong course?
            </p>

                Students may change their schedules with the assistance 
                of their advisor at any time before the add/drop deadline, provided there are available 
                seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered 
                the add/drop period. Courses that are 
                “dropped” during this period will not appear on 
                the student’s transcript. Contact your 
                <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
                visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor
                </url> to make any changes. Rearranging 
                your schedule does pose challenges, so you 
                are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the
                start of the semester. If you are considering switching 
                your math class during the first week of classes,
                you are encouraged to talk to your 
                instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in 
                their course. You will 
                be expected to make up any work in your added 
                classes that you may have missed during the transition.

                The add/drop deadline is posted on the

        <statement>
        <p>
            What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now  
            and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher  
            course?  
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112
                to take a subsequent course, you are 
                welcome to study mathematics over the 
                remainder of the summer with the intention of 
                enrolling in a higher course. There are many 
                online algebra resources available on the web. 
                You are encouraged to consult the course textbook 
                as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you improve your mathematics skills and 
                wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your
                <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
                visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor</url> 
                after you have studied the material. Since students often  
                find that the summer flies by quicker than 
                anticipated and that learning on their own 
                is challenging, we ask that 
                you select a mathematics course based on where 
                you are now, and then request a schedule change 
                if summer study makes a difference.

                On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite 
                skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select 
                the higher course now.
