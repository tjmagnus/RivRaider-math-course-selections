            What should I do if I have possible college credit 
            (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate,

            As soon as you have your scores or transcripts, 
            contact your <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
            visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor</url>. Advisors will 
            assist you in receiving credit where appropriate 
            and adjusting your fall schedule.

                What if I change my mind about my math course 
                or realize during the first week of the semester  
                that I am in the wrong course?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Students may change their schedules with the assistance 
                of their advisor at any time before the add/drop deadline, provided there are available 
                seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered 
                the add/drop period. Courses that are 
                “dropped” during this period will not appear on 
                the student’s transcript. Contact your 
                <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
                visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor
                </url> to make any changes. Rearranging 
                your schedule does pose challenges, so you 
                are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the
                start of the semester. If you are considering switching 
                your math class during the first week of classes,
                you are encouraged to talk to your 
                instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in 
                their course. You will 
                be expected to make up any work in your added 
                classes that you may have missed during the transition.
            </p>

                The add/drop deadline is posted on the

        <statement>
        <p>
            What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now  
            and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher  
            course?  
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112
                to take a subsequent course, you are 
                welcome to study mathematics over the 
                remainder of the summer with the intention of 
                enrolling in a higher course. There are many 
                online algebra resources available on the web. 
                You are encouraged to consult the course textbook 
                as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you improve your mathematics skills and 
                wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your
                <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
                visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor</url> 
                after you have studied the material. Since students often  
                find that the summer flies by quicker than 
                anticipated and that learning on their own 
                is challenging, we ask that 
                you select a mathematics course based on where 
                you are now, and then request a schedule change 
                if summer study makes a difference.

                On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite 
                skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select 
                the higher course now.

        <statement>
            <p>
                What if I am still not sure about which course to choose?
            </p>

            <p component="quant">
                We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem a 
                daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems 
                reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. If it 
                seemed too easy or too difficult, choose a course above or below 
                it as appropriate. Courses recommended for Quantitative Majors in 
                increasing order of difficulty are: <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/>,
                <xref ref="ch-CA" text="title"/>, <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/>, or a
                <xref ref="ch-above130">course above MA130</xref>. Perhaps, your skill
                set lies somewhere between two courses. How comfortable are you with 
                tackling mathematical challenges and seeking help when needed? How much
                support have you relied on in previous courses? Note also that 
                <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> and <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/> are only
                offered in fall semesters so you may want to take MA130 if you are mostly 
                ready. It is easier to drop down to <xref ref="ch-CA" text="title"/> from 
                <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/> during the first week of class than
                the other way around.    
            </p>
            <p component="nursing">
                We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem
                to be a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems 
                reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. Courses recommended for 
                Nursing Majors in increasing order of difficulty are: <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> and
                <xref ref="ch-QL" text="title"/>. Perhaps, your skill
                set lies somewhere between the two courses. Taking <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> is a benefit to 
                the students who really need it, but it means the loss of the only elective slot in the nursing degree plan.
                As a nursing major, you will be taking other 
                challenging courses in your first year, but it is also helpful to complete 
                <xref ref="ch-QL" text="title"/> early in your program to prepare you for the mathematics 
                in your nursing program. How comfortable are you with 
                tackling mathematical challenges and seeking help when needed? How much
                support have you relied on in previous courses?

            <p component="educ">
                We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem
                to be a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems 
                reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. Otherwise, consider the following:
                As an Education Major, you should first determine whether you need  
                <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> since that course will help prepare you for your Core Math course, 
                some education courses, and your licensure exams. Taking <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> is a benefit to 
                the students who really need it, but many students are ready to complete their core math 
                requirement. Education majors who can do most of the skills in <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> should 
                consider whether they would benefit from <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/> which delves deeper into the geometry 
                needed for K-8 teaching and tested on the licensure exam. <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/> is only offered in the spring 
                semester so Education majors choosing mathematics as their specialization may opt to take <xref ref="ch-Puzzles" text="title"/>
                or <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/> in their first semester.

                requirement. Because your degree plan does not specify a mathematics course, you may choose whichever of the Core Math Requirement
                courses, <xref ref="ch-QL" text="title"/>, <xref ref="ch-Puzzles" text="title"/>, <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/>, or  <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/>
                sounds the most interesting to you. Of these, <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/> requires a strong working knowledge of
                algebra and graphing. The table in <xref ref="gen-ed-sec-options"/> illustrates some other differences between these courses.
