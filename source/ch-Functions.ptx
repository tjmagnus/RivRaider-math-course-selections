    <title>MA130 Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA130 gives students the preparation they need to 
        succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge 
        of algebraic and transcendental functions to other 
        fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, 
        trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and 
        piecewise-defined functions are examined from 
        symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of 
        view.

        <title>Topics in MA130 Functions</title>
        <p>
            Topics includeÂ sketching and analyzing graphs, 
            rates of change, inverses, and transformations of 
            functions. Applications to science, social science, 
            and business will be included. Students will be 
            encouraged to become more independent mathematical 
            thinkers as they solve problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This course is not available for credit to students who 
            have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 
            or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus
            course in high school which focused primarily on computations
            with little attention to theory and applications 
            may benefit from MA130 and are allow to enroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning 
            outcomes for MA112 College Algebra,
            a course recommended only for students 
            who plan also to take MA130 Functions. In MA130, it 
            will be assumed that students can
            simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic 
            equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope
            and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional 
            notation prior to the start of the course. 
        </p>

            Sample prerequisite problems may be viewed at 
            <xref ref="ch-CA" text="custom">MA112 College Algebra</xref> and 
            at the end of the current page. You are encouraged to look at these  
            problems, attempting and self-checking enough of them to determine 
            whether you are prepared for MA130 Functions.
            If most of these algebra problems in 
            <xref ref="ch-CA" text="custom">MA112 College Algebra</xref> are 
            difficult for you, you might want to begin in MA112 instead of MA130.

        <title>What will I learn in MA130 Functions?</title>
        <introduction>
          <p> 
            At the end of MA130, you should be able to do the following. You 
            are not expected to be able to do these problems at the beginning of the course. 
            Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions will be introduced 
            in MA130, but students should already have a strong grasp of linear functions 
            and experience working with absolute values, polynomials, radicals, and 
            exponents.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    (a) The growth is exponential. Each year we have the amount that was 
                    in the account the previous year plus an additional 0.05 times that 
                    amount. Thus, we are multiplying the amount in the account by $1+0.05$
                    each year giving a formula of <m>A(t)=30000(1.05)^t</m>. 
                
                    (b) <m>30000(1.05)^5\approx 32.288</m>;

            Some students need to reinforce their algebraic skills 
            and understanding to prepare for success in MA130. If you 
            are able to do most of the problems in the next set on your 
            own, then you should do well in MA130. If you want to eventually 
            take Functions and possibly Calculus but you 
            struggle with most of these prerequisite problems, then you 
            should begin in MA112 College Algebra. More information is available  
            in the <url

            visual="mathematics course selection document for majors in quantitative 
            fields"</url>. 
            If do not plan on taking MA130 either now or in the future, 
            we recommend that you choose <xref ref="ch-Puzzles" text="title"> or 
            <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/>, not MA112.

        <title>Choosing Your Course</title>
            <p>
              To summarize, MA130 Functions is the right course for you if 
              you are strong in algebra techniques, such as those shown in 
              <xref ref="sec-functions-ready"/>, but find many of the problems 
              in <xref ref="exer-130"/>
              to be unfamiliar or difficult. In MA130, there will also be an emphasis on 
              doing problems that are closer to how you encounter mathematics beyond the classroom; your 
              ability to take a mathematical situation and rephrase it into a formula will grow. 
              
              On the other hand, if you are very comfortable completing most of 
              the above problems on your own with only minor errors, 
              then you may be ready to enroll in <xref ref="ch-above130" 
              text="custom">MA165 Calculus 
              or a higher-level course</xref>. Select "course above MA130" on the 
              Directed Self-Placement Tool and talk to your advisor and/or 
              the mathematics program director to help you determine the right 
              course for you.
              Credit for Advanced Placement exams will be considered once scores 
              are received (see <xref ref="ch-FAQ" text="title"/>).
              </p>
              <p>
              If you are ready to confirm your mathematics course selection 
              or consider courses above MA130, return to the Directed Self-Placement and 
              check the box for the desired course of action.
