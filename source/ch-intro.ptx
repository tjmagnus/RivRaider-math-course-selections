    <title>Guide to Selecting Courses</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey
      to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As you were directed to this document, a course was probably 
      recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical 
      background. <!--Add something here about how to access the survey--> 
      If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, 
      and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you 
      were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy 
      or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left
      to explore 
      other options recommended for your major. 
      If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement 
      Survey, you should 
      return to the survey after making your selection to record your  
      decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation
      and use this information to develop your schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your major
      and your mathematical history both play a role in 
      identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. 
      The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably 
      challenged and where you have the necessary 
      preparation yet still have more to learn. 
      This type of learning environment is where you will be most 
      engaged and successful.

        <title>Learning Outcomes and Readiness</title>
      <p>
      As you explore this document,
      you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during 
      the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems 
      yet. On the other hand, if you can do them all, you will likely become bored and 
      unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend 
      your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you 
      will find that 
      you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there
      there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.
      </p>   
      <p>
      Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that 
      concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about 
      all students and are happy to help students outside of class, 
      they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs 
      of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University 
      offers a single course, <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> 
      for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills
      before enrolling in their general-education math course. 
      Students who question their ability to perform these skills 
      are encouraged to use the problems in <xref ref="MR-exer"/> to self-assess 
      their readiness for further coursework.

      Students not majoring in nursing, education, or a quantitative
      field may choose from a broader selection of courses. Some courses focus 
      on skill-building and applying mathematical content while others may 
      broaden your view on what mathematics is.
      Every mathematics course aims to develop your problem-solving, reasoning, 
      and technical communication skills; there's more to mathematics than computation.  
      These courses can contribute to your academic, professional, 
      and personal goals as you develop higher-level thinking skills and 
      mathematical habits of mind. You may be headed toward a career or 
      graduate program where Functions and Calculus would enhance your 
      resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies 
      games, art, and other 
      less technical pursuits. The table below gives an indication of 
      what may be encountered in each course.

    <p component="educ">
      Students majoring in education will want to consider how their choice 
      of a mathematics course can give them deeper understanding into the 
      mathematics that they will be teaching and prepare them to pass the 
      required licensure exams for educational certification. In addition, some  
      mathematics courses encourage communication skills and creative and 
      logical thinking all of which will  
      enhance your teaching. One course, 
      <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/> 
      has been designed to meet the needs of 
      elementary and early childhood education majors. It covers and delves  
      deeper into the geometry concepts taught in the K-8 setting while 
      encouraging curiosity and discovery. In addition, education majors may 
      choose mathematics as their area of specialization. To complete this specialization,
      six courses in mathematics, normally MA110 Introductory Statistics, 
      <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="title"/>,
      <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/>, 
      MA165 Calculus I,  
      a course above 200, and 
      one additional course like <xref ref="ch-Puzzles" text="title"/>. 
      Highly-prepared students may request permission 
      to take higher-level alternatives. Each of these courses encourage 
      the development of mathematical 
      practices as well as content knowledge. The table below gives an indication of 
      what is emphasized in each mathematics course.

        If you are majoring in mathematics, biology, cybersecurity management,
        exercise science, or considering graduate study in medicine, 
        veterinary medicine, computer science, or engineering, you should 
        should determine which of the following courses matches your level 
        of preparedness: <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/>, 
        <xref ref="ch-CA" text="title"/>, or <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/>.
        If you have a strong background in Calculus, trigonometry, exponential,
        and logarithmic functions, you may be ready for a course
