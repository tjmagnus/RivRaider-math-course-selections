    <title>Guide to Selecting Courses</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey
      to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you were directed to this document, a course was probably 
      recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical 
      background. <!--Add something here about how to access the survey--> 
      You are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, 
      and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you 
      were appropriately placed. If the course looks too easy 
      or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar 
      to explore 
      other options recommended for your major. 
      If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement 
      Survey, you should 
      return to the survey after making your selection to record this  
      decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation
      and use this information to develop your schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your major
      and your mathematical history both play a role in 
      identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. 
      The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably 
      challenged and where you have the necessary 
      preparation yet still have more to learn. 
      This type of learning environment is where you will be most 
      engaged and successful.

      As you explore this document,
      you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during 
      the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems 
      yet. If you can do them all, you will likely become bored and 
      unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend 
      your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? It is okay if 
      you can do some of the learning objectives so long as there are enough 
      others to keep you engaged.
      </p>

      Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that 
      concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about 
      all students and are happy to help students outside of class, 
      they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs 
      of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University 
      offers a single course, <xref ref="ch-MR" text="custom">MA100 Math Refresher</xref> 
      for students who would like to improve their basic algebra skills. 
      Students who question their ability to perform these skills 
      are encouraged to use the problems in <xref ref="MR-exer"/> to self-assess 
      their readiness for further coursework.

      Students not majoring in nursing, education, or a quantitative
      field may choose from a broader selection of courses. Some courses focus 
      on skill-building and applying mathematical content while 
      others may develop your problem-solving, reasoning, or technical 
      communication skills.  
      These courses can contribute to your academic, professional, 
      and personal goals as you develop higher-level thinking skills and 
      mathematical habits of mind. You may be headed toward a career or 
      graduate program where Functions ande Calculus would enhance your 
      resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies 
      games, art, and other 
      less technical pursuits. In reality, most mathematics courses touch on 
      all of these in some way, but the table below gives an indication of 
      what is emphasized in each course.

    <p component="educ">
      Students majoring in education will want to consider how their choice 
      of a mathematics course can give them deeper understanding into the 
      mathematics that they will be teaching and prepare them to pass the 
      required licensure exams for educational certification. In addition, some  
      mathematics courses encourage communication skills and creative and 
      logical thinking all of which will  
      enhance your teaching. One course, 
      <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="custom">MA127 Geometrical Explorations</xref> 
      has been designed to meet the needs of 
      elementary and early childhood education majors. It covers and delves  
      deeper into the geometry concepts taught in the K-8 setting while 
      encouraging curiosity and discovery. In addition, education majors may 
      choose mathematics as their area of specialization. To complete this specialization,
      six courses in mathematics, normally MA110 Introductory Statistics, 
      <xref ref="ch-GeoEx" text="custom">MA127 Geometrical Exploration</xref>,
      <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="custom">MA130 Functions</xref>, 
      MA165 Calculus I,  
      a course above 200, and 
      one additional course like <xref ref="ch-Puzzles" text="custom">
        MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability</xref>. 
      Highly prepared students may request permission 
      to take higher-level alternatives. Each course encourages the development of mathematical 
      practices as well as content knowledge. The table below gives an indication of 
      what is emphasized in each entry-level mathematics course that satisfies the core requirement.

      Rivier University students are required to take at least 
      one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or 
      above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement 
      encourage students to move beyond basic skills 
      and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to 
      solving problems in various fields. Students will 
      see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore 
      beauty, and understand our world and they will 
      be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, 
      making them more valuable in today’s world.
