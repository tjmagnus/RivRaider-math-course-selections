<div class="para">It is expected that most entering nursing majors will not be able to do the problems in <a href="ch-QL.html#exercises-MA123" class="internal" title="Exercises 3.2">Exercises 3.2</a> above. Unless you could set up and complete nearly all of these, you should decide whether this course MA123 Quantitative Literacy or <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> is the appropriate course for you. You can self-assess whether you would benefit from taking <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> by trying the exercises in <a href="ch-MR.html#MR-exer" class="internal" title="Exercises 2.1: What will I learn in MA100 Math Refresher?">Exercises 2.1</a>. Choose <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> only if you need to develop skills in working with fractions, simplifying expressions, and solving linear equations. If you take MA100, you will have no other electives in your nursing degree plan. Some skills will be briefly reviewed in MA123, but with less depth and a faster pace than in MA100.</div>
