<div class="para">We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem to be a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. Courses recommended for Nursing Majors in increasing order of difficulty are: <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> and <a href="ch-QL.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA123 Quantitative Literacy">MA123 Quantitative Literacy</a>. Perhaps, your skill set lies somewhere between the two courses. Taking <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> is a benefit to the students who really need it, but it means the loss of the only elective slot in the nursing degree plan. As a nursing major, you will be taking other challenging courses in your first year, but it is also helpful to complete <a href="ch-QL.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA123 Quantitative Literacy">MA123 Quantitative Literacy</a> early in your program to prepare you for the mathematics in your nursing program. How comfortable are you with tackling mathematical challenges and seeking help when needed? How much support have you relied on in previous courses?</div>
