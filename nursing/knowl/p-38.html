<div class="para">Before taking MA123, students will be expected to have prior proficiency in performing operations on fractions, simplifying algebraic expressions, solving linear equations, and working with percents and decimals. Normally, the use of a calculator is allowed in this course, but students need to be able to convert word problems to algebraic equations, recognizing how to input values and solve for the appropriate variable. Students needing to strengthen these skills are encouraged to consider starting in <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a>. To test your readiness for MA123, you are encouraged to attempt the problems in <a href="ch-MR.html#MR-exer" class="internal" title="Exercises 2.1: What will I learn in MA100 Math Refresher?">Exercises 2.1</a> and then check your work. You do not need to be able to do the problems below in <a href="ch-QL.html#sec-MA123-LO" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: What will I learn in MA123 Quantitative Literacy?">Section 3.2</a>; you will learn these skills and concepts during the course.</div>
