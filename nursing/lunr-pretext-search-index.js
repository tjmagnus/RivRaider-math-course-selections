  "body": " Guide to Selecting Courses   Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  As you were directed to this document, a course was probably recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical background. If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left to explore other options recommended for your major. If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement Survey, you should return to the survey after making your selection to record your decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.    Learning Outcomes and Readiness  As you explore this document, you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems yet. On the other hand, if you can do them all, you will likely become bored and unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you will find that you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.  Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about all students and are happy to help students outside of class, they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University offers a single course, for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills before enrolling in their general-education math course. Students who question their ability to perform these skills are encouraged to use the problems in to self-assess their readiness for further coursework.    Recommended Mathematics Courses for Nursing Majors  The course focuses on mathematical concepts and procedures that are useful in the field of nursing. Students who can perform the skills in are encouraged to enroll in . Nursing majors who have a strong mathematical background and can confidently solve the problems in should contact their academic advisor for guidance.   "

The goals of this course are to develop and strengthen the skills needed for subsequent courses in mathematics and other fields and to build your self-confidence in using mathematics. MA100 does not fulfill the general education mathematics requirement--you will need to take a second mathematics course regardless of your major—but the does contribute toward the total number of credits needed for graduation taking the place of a general elective.  There are no prerequisites for this course.    Topics in Math Refresher  Topics in MA100 include computations with signed numbers, fractions, and exponents; reading and solving word problems; using algebraic properties to simplify expressions and solve equations; graphing and determining equations of lines; and solving systems of two equations in two unknowns. Sample problems that you should be able to do at the end of the semester are given below. If you are able to do these problems now, you should be ready to ready to take your general education mathematics course requirement without taking MA100. Read on!   What will I learn in MA100 Math Refresher?   At the end of MA100, you should be able to do the following:   Perform operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with signed numbers and fractions  Compute the following without a calculator                    (a) ; (b) , (c) .

  "title": "MA123 Quantitative Literacy",
  "body": " MA123 Quantitative Literacy   In Quantitative Literacy, you will learn how to read, understand, and interpret the numerical data that permeates our lives. You will apply problem-solving skills to make financial decisions, use proportional reasoning to convert units, apply your knowledge of percentages to multistage processes, apply the appropriate amount of precision in making claims, recognize the difference between linear and exponential growth, and use two-way tables to analyze false negatives and false positives. You will become aware of how mathematics may be used by others to mislead you and how to ensure that you are interpreting and presenting your results honestly and accurately.    Am I ready for MA123 Quantitative Literacy?  Before taking MA123, students will be expected to have prior proficiency in performing operations on fractions, simplifying algebraic expressions, solving linear equations, and working with percents and decimals. Normally, the use of a calculator is allowed in this course, but students need to be able to convert word problems to algebraic equations, recognizing how to input values and solve for the appropriate variable. Students needing to strengthen these skills are encouraged to consider starting in . To test your readiness for MA123, you are encouraged to attempt the problems in and then check your work. You do not need to be able to do the problems below in ; you will learn these skills and concepts during the course.    What will I learn in MA123 Quantitative Literacy?  At the end of MA123 (not now!), you should be able to do the following types of exercises. Calculators are allowed unless specified. These problems are provided to give you a sense of what you will learn in this course. You need only try enough of these problems to check that this course will not be too easy and repetitive for you. If you do complete problems, you are encouraged to view the provided answers and solutions after (not before) you finish each group of problems.    Reasoning proportionally and convert between units  The cost of a liter of gasoline in Brasilia in June 2023 was 5.23 Brazilian Real. Determine the equivalent cost in US dollars per gallon. Use the exchange rate 1 B Real = 0.21 US Dollar and the conversion factor 1 liter = 0.264 gallon in your work. Round to the nearest penny per gallon.      How do we define being able to do this problem? Speed is less important that reasoning it out. Can you set it up and use your knowledge of multiplication and division of fractions? Searching for similar problems to mimic, looking at the solution, or randomly trying operations does not count as knowledge of the topic.   4.16 US dollars per gallon       Understanding and using percentages  Write as a simplified fraction.       If you take a 5 percent cut in pay this year and then get a 10 percent raise the following year, by what percent will your salary grow over the two-year period?  Select from the following:   2.5 %    4.5 %    5.0 %    7.5 %      What if you are making $100,000?   b. Your salary will grow by 4.5 percent. Note that 5.0 percent is incorrect since percent growth is not additive.   If your salary at the beginning of the problem is , then your salary will be after the first year and after the second year.   Your restaurant bill of $55.59 includes a 9% meals tax. What was the charge for the meal before the tax was added? Your answer should be correct to the nearest cent.   $51.00. If you got $50.59, you made the common mistake of subtracting from $55.59. Check your work by increasing your answer by 9 percent. Do you get $55.59?   The unknown quantity in this problem is the amount before the 9% tax is added. We solve which can be rewritten as .   Use scientific notation effectively  Your calculator displays the number which is equivalent to . Which of the following best describes the magnitude of this number?   The number is between 5 and 6.    The number is between 10 and 1000.    The number is between 50000 and 60000.    The number is between 500000 and 600000.      d. The number is 514,728.4. You should be able to do this type of exercise without a calculator.   Perform the following operations without a calculator. Express your answers in scientific notation.                 (a) ; (b) ; (c)   (a) ; (b) ;    Use mathematics to make wise financial decisions     Prorate income sources and expenses to monthly and determine the net monthly income or loss for an individual.    Determine whether an insurance policy would be a good deal by weighing the overall cost of the policy against estimated out-of-pocket expenses without a policy.    Argue whether it is better, both financially and economically, to trade your old car for a new one.      Answering these questions would require more information that is given here. These examples are included to illustrate how many of the problems in this course involve more research and reasoning and connections to our daily life.   Use two-way tables to analyze probabilities  A positive test should indicate that a person has the disease and a negative test should indicate that a person does not have the disease. These tests unfortunately are not 100% accurate.  The following table breaks down a sample of 100 people who were tested for Disease L according to whether they had Disease L and whether the test indicated that they had the disease. Use the table to answer the questions that follow:   Test results and incidence for disease L       Patient has L  Patient does not have L  Total    Test indicated disease L  8  2  10    Test did not indicate disease  4  86  90    Total  12  88  100       If a patient's test indicates that they have the disease, what is the probability that they actually do not have Disease L?    If a patient does not have Disease L, what is the probability that the test will confirm that they do not have the disease?     (a) 20 percent; (b) 97.73 percent   For b, we divide 86 by 88. Knowing how to do this type of problem means that you can read the two-way table and determine which values you need to divide to determine the probability. In addition, you may be asked to complete a partially-filled table.   Recognize whether growth is linear or exponential and solve problems involving each type  A city in Texas had a population of 100000 in January 2020 and was growing at a rate of 6% per year.   What is the approximate doubling time at this growth rate?    If the growth rate were to continue, what would the city's population be in 2050?      (a) approximately 11.9 years; (b) nearly 574,350      We solve the equation . We can divide both sides by , leaving . One way to complete this problem is to graph and on the same coordinate graph (using technology) to see where the curves intersect. To solve this by computations, we would take a logarithm (log or ln) of both sides to get .    .        Next Steps  It is expected that most entering nursing majors will not be able to do the problems in above. Unless you could set up and complete nearly all of these, you should decide whether this course MA123 Quantitative Literacy or is the appropriate course for you. You can self-assess whether you would benefit from taking by trying the exercises in . Choose only if you need to develop skills in working with fractions, simplifying expressions, and solving linear equations. If you take MA100, you will have no other electives in your nursing degree plan. Some skills will be briefly reviewed in MA123, but with less depth and a faster pace than in MA100.  Do you have a strong mathematics background? If you are a nursing major and can complete nearly all of the problems in on your own, you might not be required to take a mathematics course and could be eligible to take a free elective instead. Since you will need to do problems similar to in your nursing courses and licensure exams, this waiver is only granted for students with exceptionally strong math backgrounds. Your academic advisor and the mathematics program director will review your request for a waiver of the mathematics requirement. If you change your major later, you will need to fulfill the mathematics requirement to graduate.  Once you have determined whether MA123 Quantitative Literacy, MA100 Math Refresher is the better choice for you, return to the Directed Self-Placement Survey to record your selection. If you believe that you qualify for a waiver, select \"Course above MA130\" on the Directed Self-Placement Survey.   "
