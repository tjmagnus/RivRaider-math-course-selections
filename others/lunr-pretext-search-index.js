  "body": " Guide to Selecting Courses   Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  As you were directed to this document, a course was probably recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical background. If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left to explore other options recommended for your major. If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement Survey, you should return to the survey after making your selection to record your decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.    Learning Outcomes and Readiness  As you explore this document, you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems yet. On the other hand, if you can do them all, you will likely become bored and unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you will find that you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.  Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about all students and are happy to help students outside of class, they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University offers a single course, for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills before enrolling in their general-education math course. Students who question their ability to perform these skills are encouraged to use the problems in to self-assess their readiness for further coursework.    Recommended Mathematics Courses  Students not majoring in nursing, education, or a quantitative field may choose from a broader selection of courses. Some courses focus on skill-building and applying mathematical content while others may broaden your view on what mathematics is. Every mathematics course aims to develop your problem-solving, reasoning, and technical communication skills; there's more to mathematics than computation. These courses can contribute to your academic, professional, and personal goals as you develop higher-level thinking skills and mathematical habits of mind. You may be headed toward a career or graduate program where Functions and Calculus would enhance your resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies games, art, and other less technical pursuits. The table below gives an indication of what may be encountered in each course.

You will solve logic puzzles, observe number patterns, appreciate the importance of number theory in our digital world, learn what makes rational numbers so different from irrationals, question whether there might be more than one size of infinity, compute probabilities, stumble upon paradoxes, and be introduced to some conjectures that have not yet been proved to be true (or false)! If you enjoy puzzles and games and figuring stuff out, this may be the class for you.  The content of MA126 may vary, but some of the questions below are often explored:   If I could fold a paper in half 50 times, how high would it be?    Continue the sequence . What do we notice about the ratios ?    Why must there be an infinite number of primes? What role do prime numbers play in our digital world?    Is a rational number? How do I write as a fraction?   What is the missing digit in the UPC code X?   Whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers: Are these sets of numbers the same size or are there different sizes of infinity?    What is the probability that two people in the class share a birthday?    How can I use logic and mathematics to ensure that I will win a two-player game? Does it matter whether I play first or second?     To be successful in MA126, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, converting between units, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be willing to read word problems and develop strategies to solve them.

Topics include construction and measurement of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures, tilings, transformations, regularity, congruence and similarity, and impossibility. Students practice thinking outside the box, exploring why geometrical formulas work, and making arguments that use diagrams and words. The topics are chosen to help Education majors prepare for the Praxis and similar licensure exams, but students of all majors are welcome to develop their tactile, visual, and verbal reasoning skills, to strengthen their geometrical understanding, and to make clear logic arguments. If you like building things and making art, this might be a good fit for you.    What will I explore in MA127?  Topics covered may vary, but often includes the following:   Determine the formula for the area of a trapezoid by cutting it up into rectangles, triangles, and\/or parallelograms.    Explain why the Pythagorean theorem holds by rearranging triangles and squares into other shapes.    Create tilings and quilt patterns and discover which regular polygons can be used to make symmetric designs.    Build three-dimensional solids with polygonal faces and explore the possibilities and patterns.    Determine which logos have reflective and rotational symmetry and discover the relationships between the angle of rotation and the number of reflecting lines.    Discover what happens when you reflect a figure across two lines in succession. When is it a rotation? A translation?    What number patterns arise from the study of star polygons, kaleidoscopes, billiard ball paths, and fractals?    What happens to familiar geometrical properties when you create shapes on a sphere instead of a flat surface? Do they still hold? Are there other geometries other that Euclidean geometry?       Am I ready for MA127?  To be successful in MA127, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, working with exponents and square roots, plotting points on a graph, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be able to follow the steps in a task and think outside the box. Good writing skills will help as you learn how to develop clear explanations and incorporate visuals and symbolic expressions. Some fundamental topics such as computing areas and perimeters, using the Pythagorean Theorem, and the simplifying square roots will be reviewed briefly at the appropriate time in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a \"can-do\" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas with others, to notice patterns, and to give explanations.    Next Steps  If you are ready to sign up for MA127 Geometrical Explorations or have decided on another mathematics course, you may return to the Directed Self-Placement Tools and record your selection. If you would like to explore other options, for completing your mathematics requirement, you may look at MA123 Quantitative Literacy , MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probabilities , or MA130 Functions . If you are concerned about your readiness for these mathematics courses, you may explore MA100 Math Refresher as an option before making your decision.   "

  "title": "MA130 Functions",
  "body": " MA130 Functions   MA130 gives students the preparation they need to succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge of algebraic and transcendental functions to other fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view.    Topics in MA130 Functions  Topics include sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.  This course is not available for credit to students who have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus course in high school which focused primarily on computations with little attention to theory and applications may benefit from MA130.  The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112 College Algebra, a course recommended only for students who plan also to take MA130 Functions. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation.   What will I learn in MA130 Functions?   At the end of MA130, you should be able to do the following. You do not need to be able to do these problems at the beginning of the course. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions will be introduced in MA130, but students should already have a strong grasp of linear functions and the ability to simplify expressions involving polynomials, radicals, and exponents.   Compute and Analyze Rates of Change    Given , determine the rate of change of over the interval to .    Identify from the graph of , given below, where has a positive rate of change.     a. ; (b) Function has a positive rate of change on the interval .    The graph of a function that starts at the lower left, rising to just touch the x-axis at the point (-2,0), then falling to the point (2,-4) after crossing the y-axis at (0,-2). To the right of (2,-4), the graph goes upward crossing the x-axis at (4,0) and continuing upward.   Work with functions defined graphically Given the graph of above, determine the following:        The solution(s) of .     Work with functions defined verbally  The money in a bank account is increasing by 5% every year. There is $30,000 in the account in 2020.    Write a formula for $A(t)$, the amount of money in the account years after 2020.    Determine the amount of money in the account in 2025.    In what year will the amount of money reach $100,000?     Is this function linear, exponential, or something else?

Each year we have the amount that was in the account the previous year plus an additional 0.05 times that amount. Thus, we are multiplying the amount in the account by $1+0.05$ each year giving a formula of . (b) ; (c) Solve using logarithms or by viewing where the curves of and intersect on a graphing calculator or similar app. To use logarithms,    Determine the inverse of a function and use it to solve problems    Determine the inverses of the following functions:         Use inverse properties to simplify .

Some students need to reinforce their algebraic skills and understanding to prepare for success in MA130. If you are able to do most of the problems in the next set on your own, then you should do well in MA130. If your degree and career plan includes a need for Functions or Calculus and you struggle with most of these prerequisite problems, then you may want to start in MA112. If you do not plan on taking MA130 later, we recommend that you choose one of the other options accessible from the left sidebar.   What will I learn in MA112 College Algebra   At the end of MA112, you should be able to do the following:   Simplify Algebraic Expressions  Simplify the following:               a. ; (b)               Solve Linear and Quadratic Equations  Solve each of the following:           Using a guess-and-check method does not qualify as understanding this concept.   (a) ; (b) or       One method of solving this problem is to use the distributive property to get . Adding to both sides gives or . Thus, and .   Expanding the left side, we get which can be rewritten as . Factoring the polynomial gives us so that or .     Work with exponents and radicals  Simplify the following expressions:           (a) ; (b) ; (c)                  Determine an Equation for a Line  Determine an equation for the line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line .   Possible solutions include and .   In order for the line to be perpendicular to , the slope of the line must be . We can then use this slope together with the point to find the -intercept by solving . Another option is to substitute into the point-slope form to get, .   Solve systems of linear equations  Find the ordered pair that satisfies the system:   You should be able to solve this problem algebraically either by elimination or by the substitution method. Using a guess-and-check strategy does not count as understanding this concept.   ; that is, and .   Factor polynomials and solve polynomial equations    Factor .    Solve .     (a) ; (b)    Combine and evaluate functions  Let and . Determine the following:                         (a) ; (b) ; (c) ; (d)                                Choosing Your Course  MA130 is the right course for you if you can do most of the algebraic techniques in , but find many of the problems in to be new or difficult. In MA130, there will also be an emphasis on doing problems that are closer to how you encounter mathematics beyond the classroom; your ability to take a mathematical situation and rephrase it into a formula will grow.  On the other hand, if you are comfortable completing most of the problems on your own with only minor errors, then you may be ready to enroll in MA165 Calculus or a higher-level course . Talk to your advisor and\/or the mathematics program director to help you determine the right course for you. Credit for Advanced Placement exams will be considered once scores are received.  If you are ready to confirm your mathematics course selection or inquire about courses above MA130, return to the Directed Self-Placement and check the box for the desired course of action.   "

Students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor at any time before the add\/drop deadline, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered the add\/drop period. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Contact your academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges, so you are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the start of the semester. If you are considering switching your math class during the first week of classes, you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in their course.
