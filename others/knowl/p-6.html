<div class="para">Students not majoring in nursing, education, or a quantitative field may choose from a broader selection of courses. Some courses focus on skill-building and applying mathematical content while others may broaden your view on what mathematics is. Every mathematics course aims to develop your problem-solving, reasoning, and technical communication skills; there's more to mathematics than computation. These courses can contribute to your academic, professional, and personal goals as you develop higher-level thinking skills and mathematical habits of mind. You may be headed toward a career or graduate program where Functions and Calculus would enhance your resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies games, art, and other less technical pursuits. The table below gives an indication of what may be encountered in each course.</div>
