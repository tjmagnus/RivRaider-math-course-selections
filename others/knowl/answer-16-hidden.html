<div class="para">If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112 to take a subsequent course, you are welcome to study mathematics over the remainder of the summer with the intention of enrolling in a higher course. There are many online algebra resources available on the web. You are encouraged to consult the course textbook as well.</div> <div class="para">If you improve your mathematics skills and wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your <a class="external" href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" target="_blank">academic advisor</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> after you have studied the material. Since students often find that the summer flies by quicker than anticipated and that learning on their own is challenging, we ask that you select a mathematics course based on where you are now, and then request a schedule change if summer study makes a difference. On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select the higher course now.</div>
