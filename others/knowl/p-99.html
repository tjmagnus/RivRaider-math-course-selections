<div class="para">To be successful in MA126, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, converting between units, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be willing to read word problems and develop strategies to solve them. Some algebraic topics such as prime factorization, long division, and the quadratic equation will be reviewed briefly when introduced in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a "can-do" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas and test out strategies with others.</div>
