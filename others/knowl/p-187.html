<div class="para">Students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor at any time before the add/drop deadline, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered the add/drop period. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Contact your <a class="external" href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" target="_blank">academic advisor</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges, so you are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the start of the semester. If you are considering switching your math class during the first week of classes, you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in their course. You will be expected to make up any work in your added classes that you may have missed during the transition.</div>
