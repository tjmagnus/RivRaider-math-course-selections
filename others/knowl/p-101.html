<div class="para">MA127 is an exploratory, tactile course in which students observe geometric relationships, make conjectures, and test them. Topics include construction and measurement of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures, tilings, transformations, regularity, congruence and similarity, and impossibility. Students practice thinking outside the box, exploring why geometrical formulas work, and making arguments that use diagrams and words. The topics are chosen to help Education majors prepare for the Praxis and similar licensure exams, but students of all majors are welcome to develop their tactile, visual, and verbal reasoning skills, to strengthen their geometrical understanding, and to make clear logic arguments. If you like building things and making art, this might be a good fit for you.</div>
