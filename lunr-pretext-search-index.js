  "title": "About this Document",
  "body": " About this Document  Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  Rivier University students are required to take at least one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement encourage students to move beyond basic skills and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to solving problems in various fields. Students will see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore beauty, and understand our world and they will be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, making them more valuable in today’s world. Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.  When you completed the first part of the survey, a course was recommended for you. You are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links to explore other options. Then return to the survey to record your selection. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  "

  "title": "MA100 Math Refresher",
  "body": " MA100 Math Refresher   MA100 is designed to refresh and review your algebra knowledge and skills. The goals of this course are to develop and strengthen the skills needed for subsequent courses in mathematics and other fields and to build your self-confidence in using mathematics. MA100 does not fulfill the general education mathematics requirement--you will need to take a second mathematics course regardless of your major—but it does count toward the credits needed for graduation.  Topics include computations with signed numbers, fractions, and exponents; reading and solving word problems; using algebraic properties to simplify expressions and solve equations; graphing and determining equations of lines; and solving systems of two equations in two unknowns. Sample problems that you should be able to do at the end of the semester are given in the next section. If you are able to do these problems now, you may be ready to ready to take your general education mathematics course requirement without taking MA100. Read on!  There are no prerequisites for this course.    What will I learn in MA100 Math Refresher   At the end of MA100, you should be able to do the following:   Perform operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with signed numbers and fractions  Compute the following without a calculator                    (a) ; (b) , (c) .   Use order of operations correctly  Compute .    .   Simplify algebraic expressions  Simplify .    . Other allowable answers include and and .   Work with exponents and radicals  Simplify the following:                    (a) ; (b) ; (c) .

(a) ; (b)     If you do not feel comfortable completing the above problems on your own, then MA100 is probably the right course for you. Return to the Directed Self-Placement and select MA100. On the other hand, if you were able to complete 80% of the problems with only minor errors and without assistance, you probably are ready for a different course. Nursing majors should look at , Quantitative majors should look at or , Education majors should look at , and students in other majors may consider , , , or .    "

  "body": " MA130 Functions   MA130 gives students the preparation they need to succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge of algebraic and transcendental functions to other fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view. Topics include sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.  This course is not available for credit to students who have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus course in high school which focused primarily on computations with little attention to theory and applications may benefit from MA130.  The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation. Sample prerequisite problems may be viewed at and will help you gage your readiness for MA130. If most of these algebra problems in are difficult for you, you might want to begin in MA112 instead of MA130.    What will I learn in MA130 Functions   At the end of MA130, you should be able to do the following. You do not need to be able to do these problems at the beginning of the course. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions will be introduced in MA130, but students should already have a strong grasp of linear functions and the ability to simplify expressions involving polynomials, radicals, and exponents.
