  "body": " About this Document  Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  When you completed the first part of the survey, a course was recommended for you. You are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links to explore other options. Then return to the survey to record your selection. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  Rivier University students are required to take at least one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement encourage students to move beyond basic skills and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to solving problems in various fields. Students will see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore beauty, and understand our world and they will be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, making them more valuable in today’s world. Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.  In addition, you should also consider the benefits that these mathematics courses may have for you and how they can contribute to your academic, professional, and personal goals. Some courses focus on skill-building and applying mathematical content while others may develop your problem-solving, reasoning, or technical communication skills. You may be headed toward a career or graduate program where Calculus would enhance your resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies games, art, and other less technical fields. In reality, most mathematics courses touch on all of these in some way, but the table below gives an indication of what is emphasized in each course.  ADD TABLE HERE.

  "body": " MA123 Quantitative Literacy   In Quantitative Literacy, you will learn how to read, understand, and interpret the numerical data that permeates our lives. You will apply problem-solving skills to make financial decisions, use proportional reasoning to convert units, apply your knowledge of percentages to multistage processes, apply the appropriate amount of precision in making claims, recognize the difference between linear and exponential growth, and use two-way tables to analyze false negatives and false positives. You will become aware of how mathematics may be used by others to mislead you and how to ensure that you are interpreting and presenting your results honestly and accurately.  If you are not majoring in Nursing, Education, or a quantitative field, you have some freedom in selecting your initial mathematics course. The course described here focuses on applying your algebra skills to every day life decisions. For some students, this is an ideal course as they gain useful tools and appreciate math through its application. Other students may already be familiar with these applications and find this course to be less useful. Read on to see and try sample problems.  Other courses that may be used to fulfill the general education mathematics requirement are MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability , MA127 Geometrical Explorations , and MA130 Functions . Click on the links to learn more about these courses.  The prerequisite for MA123 and other mathematics courses is the ability to perform basic arithmetic and algebraic skills, to solve linear equations and simplify expressions, and to work with fractions, decimals, and percents. Students needing significant strengthening of these skills are encouraged to consider starting in MA100 Math Refresher. A more detailed description of MA100 with sample problems is available in .    What will I learn in MA123 Quantitative Literacy?   At the end of MA123, you should be able to do the following. Calculators are allowed unless specified.   Reasoning proportionally and convert between units  The cost of a liter of gasoline in Brasilia in June 2023 was 5.23 Brazilian Real. Convert 5.23 Real\/liter to US dollars\/gallon. Use the exchange rate 1 B Real = 0.21 US Dollar and the conversion factor 1 liter = 0.264 gallon in your work. Round to the nearest penny per gallon.  The equivalent cost is US $ per gallon.      Correct.      Incorrect.      How do we define being able to do this problem? Speed is less important that reasoning it out. Can you set it up and use your knowledge of multiplication and division of fractions? Searching for similar problems to mimic or looking at the solution does not count as knowledge of the topic.   4.16 US dollars per gallon       Understanding and using percentages  LOOK AT WEBWORK FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS   Use scientific notation effectively  LOOK AT WEBWORK FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS   Use mathematics to make wise financial decisions  LOOK AT WEBWORK FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS   Use two-way tables to analyze probabilities  LOOK AT WEBWORK FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS   Recognize whether growth is linear or exponential and solve problems involving each type  LOOK AT WEBWORK FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS     If you are a nursing major and most of the above problems seem easy for you, you may not be required to take a mathematics course. This will allow you to take an elective course in another field. Your advisor and the mathematics program director will review your request for a waiver of the mathematics requirement or permission to take a course above MA130. If you change your major later, you will need to fulfill the mathematics requirement.  If you are unable to do the above problems on your own, you should decide whether MA100 or MA123 Quantitative Literacy is the appropriate course for you. Choose MA100 Math Refresher only if you need to develop skills in working with fractions, simplifying expressions, and solving linear equations. If you take MA100, you will have no electives in your nursing degree plan. Some of the skills will be briefly reviewed in MA123, but with less depth and a faster pace than in MA100.

Other options include MA123 Quantitative Literacy , MA127 Geometrical Explorations , and MA130 Functions .  In MA126, the focus is on mathematical thinking and open-ended problem solving. Creativity and logic will serve you well as you explore some of the big ideas of mathematics. You will explore the many patterns arising from the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …, become aware of the importance of prime numbers and remainders in our digital world, learn what makes rational numbers so different from irrationals, question whether there might be more than one size of infinity, compute probabilities, stumble upon paradoxes, and be introduced to some conjectures that have not yet been proved to be true (or false)! If you enjoy puzzles and games and figuring stuff out, this may be the class for you.  The content of MA126 may vary, but some of the questions below are often explored:   If I could fold a paper in half 50 times, how high would it be?    Continue the sequence . What do we notice about the ratios ?    Why must there be an infinite number of primes? What role do prime numbers play in our digital world?    Is a rational number? How do I write as a fraction?   What is the missing digit in the UPC code X?   Whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers: Are these sets of numbers the same size or are there different sizes of infinity?    What is the probability that two people in the class share a birthday?    How can I use logic and mathematics to ensure that I will win a two-player game? Does it matter whether I play first or second?     To be successful in MA126, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, converting between units, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be willing to read word problems and develop strategies to solve them. Some algebraic topics such as prime factorization, long division, and the quadratic equation will be reviewed briefly when introduced in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a \"can-do\" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas and test out strategies with others.

  "title": "MA127 Geometrical Explorations",
  "body": " MA127 Geometrical Explorations   MA127 is an exploratory, tactile course in which students observe geometric relationships, make conjectures, and test them. Topics include construction and measurement of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures, tilings, transformations, regularity, congruence and similarity, and impossibility. Students practice thinking outside the box, exploring why geometrical formulas work, and making arguments that use diagrams and words. The topics are chosen to help Education majors prepare for the Praxis and similar licensure exams, but students of all majors are welcome to develop their tactile, visual, and verbal reasoning skills, to strengthen their geometrical understanding, and to make clear logic arguments. If you like building things and making art, this might be a good fit for you.  If you will be teaching in the PK-6 setting, you will be teaching geometry. Your licensure test will have some geometry questions on it as well. This course will engage you in tactile, visual, and computer exploration in which you will observe and justify geometrical patterns and properties. You will grow in your understanding of why geometric properties hold, build three-dimensional solids, and experience topics beyond the typical curriculum like star polygons, tilings, and fractals. Recommended both for students needing to improve geometric skills and students wanting to explore geometry from a different perspective. Perhaps you can adapt activities from this class into lessons for your students.    What will I explore in MA127?  Topics covered may vary, but often includes the following:   Determine the formula for the area of a trapezoid by cutting it up into rectangles, triangles, and\/or parallelograms.    Explain why the Pythagorean theorem holds by rearranging triangles and squares into other shapes.    Create tilings and quilt patterns and discover which regular polygons can be used to make symmetric designs.    Build three-dimensional solids with polygonal faces and explore the possibilities and patterns.    Determine which logos have reflective and rotational symmetry and discover the relationships between the angle of rotation and the number of reflecting lines.    Discover what happens when you reflect a figure across two lines in succession. When is it a rotation? A translation?    What number patterns arise from the study of star polygons, kaleidoscopes, billiard ball paths, and fractals?    What happens to familiar geometrical properties when you create shapes on a sphere instead of a flat surface? Do they still hold? Are there other geometries other that Euclidean geometry?       Am I ready for MA127?  To be successful in MA127, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, working with exponents and square roots, plotting points on a graph, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be able to follow the steps in a task and think outside the box. Good writing skills will help as you learn how to develop clear explanations and incorporate visuals and symbolic expressions. Some fundamental topics such as computing areas and perimeters, using the Pythagorean Theorem, and the simplifying square roots will be reviewed briefly at the appropriate time in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a \"can-do\" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas with others, to notice patterns, and to give explanations.    Next Steps  If you are ready to sign up for MA127 Geometrical Explorations or have decided on another mathematics course, you may return to the Directed Self-Placement Tools and record your selection.

Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view. Topics include sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.  This course is not available for credit to students who have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus course in high school which focused primarily on computations with little attention to theory and applications may benefit from MA130.  The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation. Sample prerequisite problems may be viewed at and will help you gage your readiness for MA130. If most of these algebra problems in are difficult for you, you might want to begin in MA112 instead of MA130.    What will I learn in MA130 Functions   At the end of MA130, you should be able to do the following. You do not need to be able to do these problems at the beginning of the course. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions will be introduced in MA130, but students should already have a strong grasp of linear functions and the ability to simplify expressions involving polynomials, radicals, and exponents.

(a) ; (b)    MA130 is the right course for you if you are strong in algebra techniques (see for comparison) but find some or all of the above problems to be new or difficult. In MA130, there will also be an emphasis on doing problems that are closer to how you encounter mathematics beyond the classroom; your ability to take a mathematical situation and rephrase it into a formula will grow. On the other hand, if you are comfortable completing most of the above problems on your own with only minor errors, then you may be ready to enroll in MA165 Calculus or a higher-level course. Talk to your advisor and\/or the mathematics program director to help you determine the right course for you. Credit for Advanced Placement exams will be considered once scores are received.  If you are ready to confirm your mathematics course selection or inquire about courses above MA130, return to the Directed Self-Placement and check the box for the desired course or action.    "
