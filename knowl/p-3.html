<div class="para">When you completed the first part of the survey, a course was recommended for you. You are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links to explore other options. Then return to the survey to record your selection. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.</div>
