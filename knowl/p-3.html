<div class="para">Rivier University students are required to take at least one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement encourage students to move beyond basic skills and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to solving problems in various fields. Students will see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore beauty, and understand our world and they will be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, making them more valuable in todayâ€™s world. Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.</div>
