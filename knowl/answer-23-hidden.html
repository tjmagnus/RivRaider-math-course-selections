There are many online algebra resources available on the web. You are encourage to consult the course textbook as well.</div> <div class="para">If you improve your mathematics skills and want to be placed in a higher course, contact <a class="external" href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" target="_blank">academic advisor</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> after you have studied the material. You may find that the summer flies by quicker than you anticipated or that learning on your own is challenging. For this reason, we ask that you select a mathematics course based on where you are now, and then request a schedule change if summer study makes a difference.</div>
