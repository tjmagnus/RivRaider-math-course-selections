<div class="para">MA130 gives students the preparation they need to succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge of algebraic and transcendental functions to other fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view. Topics includeÂ sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.</div>
