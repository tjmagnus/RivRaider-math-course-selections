<div class="para">Topics in MA100 include computations with signed numbers, fractions, and exponents; reading and solving word problems; using algebraic properties to simplify expressions and solve equations; graphing and determining equations of lines; and solving systems of two equations in two unknowns. Sample problems that you should be able to do at the end of the semester are given in the next section. If you are able to do these problems now, you should be ready to ready to take your general education mathematics course requirement without taking MA100. Read on!</div>
