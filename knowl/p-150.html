<div class="para">To be successful in MA127, you need to be able to do basic algebra including operations on fractions, working with exponents and square roots, plotting points on a graph, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. You should be able to follow the steps in a task and think outside the box. Good writing skills will help as you learn how to develop clear explanations and incorporate visuals and symbolic expressions. Some fundamental topics such as computing areas and perimeters, using the Pythagorean Theorem, and the simplifying square roots will be reviewed briefly at the appropriate time in the course. Most importantly, you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a "can-do" attitude, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to explore ideas with others, to notice patterns, and to give explanations.</div>
