<div class="para">The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation. Sample prerequisite problems may be viewed at <a href="ch-CA.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA112 College Algebra">MA112 College Algebra</a> and will help you gage your readiness for MA130. If most of these algebra problems in <a href="ch-CA.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA112 College Algebra">MA112 College Algebra</a> are difficult for you, you might want to begin in MA112 instead of MA130.</div>
