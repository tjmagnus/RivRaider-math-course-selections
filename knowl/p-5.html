<div class="para">Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about all students and are happy to help students outside of class, they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University offers a single course, <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills before enrolling in their general-education math course. Students who question their ability to perform these skills are encouraged to use the problems in <a href="ch-MR.html#MR-exer" class="internal" title="Exercises 2.1: What will I learn in MA100 Math Refresher">ExercisesÂ 2.1</a> to self-assess their readiness for further coursework.</div>
