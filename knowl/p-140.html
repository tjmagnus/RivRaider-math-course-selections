<div class="para">If you will be teaching in the PK-6 setting, you will be teaching geometry. Your licensure test will have some geometry questions on it as well. This course will engage you in tactile, visual, and computer exploration in which you will observe and justify geometrical patterns and properties. You will grow in your understanding of why geometric properties hold, build three-dimensional solids, and experience topics beyond the typical curriculum like star polygons, tilings, and fractals. Recommended both for students needing to improve geometric skills and students wanting to explore geometry from a different perspective. Perhaps you can adapt activities from this class into lessons for your students.</div>
