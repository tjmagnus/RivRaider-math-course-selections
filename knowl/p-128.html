<div class="para">In MA126, the focus is on mathematical thinking and open-ended problem solving. Creativity and logic will serve you well as you explore some of the big ideas of mathematics. A good foundation in high school algebra and geometry is all you need. You will solve logic puzzles, observe number patterns, appreciate the importance of number theory in our digital world, learn what makes rational numbers so different from irrationals, question whether there might be more than one size of infinity, compute probabilities, stumble upon paradoxes, and be introduced to some conjectures that have not yet been proved to be true (or false)! If you enjoy puzzles and games and figuring stuff out, this may be the class for you.</div>
