<div class="para">The first week of each semester is considered the add/drop period. During this time, students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Be sure to talk to your instructor about your concerns and to contact your academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges though and you are encouraged to act quickly if needed. You will be expected to make up any work missed in your added classes.</div> <div class="para">The add/drop deadline is posted on the academic calendar.</div>
