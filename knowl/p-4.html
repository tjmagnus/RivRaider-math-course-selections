<div class="para">As you explore this document, you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems yet. If you can do them all, you will likely become bored and unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you will find that you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.</div>
