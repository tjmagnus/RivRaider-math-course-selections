  "body": " Guide to Selecting Courses   Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.  As you were directed to this document, a course was probably recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical background. If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left to explore other options recommended for your major. If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement Survey, you should return to the survey after making your selection to record your decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.  Your major and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary preparation yet still have more to learn. This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.    Learning Outcomes and Readiness  As you explore this document, you will see what you should expect to learn in the course during the semester. You are not expected to be able to do these problems yet. On the other hand, if you can do them all, you will likely become bored and unmotivated which often leads to low grades in the course. Why spend your tuition to relearn something you have mastered? More likely, you will find that you can do some of the learning outcomes in your ideal course but there there are enough new or unmastered outcomes to keep you engaged.  Studying mathematics can be challenging due to the fact that concepts build on prior knowledge. Although your instructors care about all students and are happy to help students outside of class, they cannot slow down a course to meet the needs of a student who overstated their abilities. Rivier University offers a single course, for students who would benefit by improving their basic algebra skills before enrolling in their general-education math course. Students who question their ability to perform these skills are encouraged to use the problems in to self-assess their readiness for further coursework.    Recommended Mathematics Courses for Majors in the Quantitative Fields  If you are majoring in mathematics, biology, cybersecurity management, exercise science, or considering graduate study in medicine, veterinary medicine, computer science, or engineering, you should should determine which of the following courses matches your level of preparedness: , , or . If you have a strong background in Calculus, trigonometry, exponential, and logarithmic functions, you may be ready for a course beyond MA130 . Follow the links to explore these options.   "

The goals of this course are to develop and strengthen the skills needed for subsequent courses in mathematics and other fields and to build your self-confidence in using mathematics. MA100 does not fulfill the general education mathematics requirement--you will need to take a second mathematics course regardless of your major—but the does contribute toward the total number of credits needed for graduation taking the place of a general elective.  There are no prerequisites for this course.    Topics in Math Refresher  Topics in MA100 include computations with signed numbers, fractions, and exponents; reading and solving word problems; using algebraic properties to simplify expressions and solve equations; graphing and determining equations of lines; and solving systems of two equations in two unknowns. Sample problems that you should be able to do at the end of the semester are given below. If you are able to do these problems now, you should be ready to ready to take your general education mathematics course requirement without taking MA100. Read on!

Linear, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and piecewise-defined functions are examined from symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of view.    Topics in MA130 Functions  Topics include sketching and analyzing graphs, rates of change, inverses, and transformations of functions. Applications to science, social science, and business will be included. Students will be encouraged to become more independent mathematical thinkers as they solve problems.  This course is not available for credit to students who have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus course in high school which focused primarily on computations with little attention to theory and applications may benefit from MA130.  The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning outcomes for MA112 College Algebra, a course recommended only for students who plan also to take MA130 Functions. It will be assumed that students can simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional notation.

Students who believe that they are ready to take a course above should contact their academic advisor who will facilitate a discussion between you and the Mathematics Program director.    Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate scores  Students who have taken an Advanced Placement Test in Calculus or an International Baccalaureate Higher Level Examination may be eligible to receive credit for a mathematics course. Once scores are received, students should contact their academic advisor to get the credit awarded and discuss schedule and degree plan options. Students who are waiting on their scores are encouraged to enroll in MA130 Functions now to reserve a seat and then to adjust their schedule once scores are available.   "

  "body": " Frequently Asked Questions    Here are the answers to some questions you might have:    What should I do if I have possible college credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Running Start, transfer credit)?   As soon as you have your scores or transcripts, contact your academic advisor . Advisors will assist you in receiving credit where appropriate and adjusting your fall schedule.    What if I change my mind about my math course or realize during the first week of the semester that I am in the wrong course?   Students may change their schedules with the assistance of their advisor at any time before the add\/drop deadline, provided there are available seats in courses to be added. The first week of each semester is considered the add\/drop period. Courses that are “dropped” during this period will not appear on the student’s transcript. Contact your academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging your schedule does pose challenges, so you are encouraged to finalize your schedule early, preferably before the start of the semester. If you are considering switching your math class during the first week of classes, you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your concerns and what you can expect in their course. You will be expected to make up any work in your added classes that you may have missed during the transition.  The add\/drop deadline is posted on the Rivier academic calendar .    What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher course?   If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112 to take a subsequent course, you are welcome to study mathematics over the remainder of the summer with the intention of enrolling in a higher course. There are many online algebra resources available on the web. You are encouraged to consult the course textbook as well.  If you improve your mathematics skills and wish to be placed in a higher course, contact your academic advisor after you have studied the material. Since students often find that the summer flies by quicker than anticipated and that learning on their own is challenging, we ask that you select a mathematics course based on where you are now, and then request a schedule change if summer study makes a difference. On the other hand, if you can do most of the prerequisite skills and only need to review a topic or two, you may select the higher course now.    What if I am still not sure about which course to choose?   We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. If it seemed too easy or too difficult, choose a course above or below it as appropriate. Courses recommended for Quantitative Majors in increasing order of difficulty are: , , , or a course above MA130 . Perhaps, your skill set lies somewhere between two courses. How comfortable are you with tackling mathematical challenges and seeking help when needed? How much support have you relied on in previous courses? Note also that and are only offered in fall semesters so you may want to take MA130 if you are mostly ready. It is easier to drop down to from during the first week of class than the other way around.    "
