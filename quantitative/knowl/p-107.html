<div class="para">MA130 is the right course for you if you are strong in algebra techniques (see <a href="ch-CA.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA112 College Algebra">Chapter 3</a> for comparison) but find many of the problems in <a href="ch-Functions.html#exer-130" class="internal" title="Exercises 4.1: What will I learn in MA130 Functions?">Exercises 4.1</a> to be new or difficult. In MA130, there will also be an emphasis on doing problems that are closer to how you encounter mathematics beyond the classroom; your ability to take a mathematical situation and rephrase it into a formula will grow. On the other hand, if you are comfortable completing most of the above problems on your own with only minor errors, then you may be ready to enroll in <a href="ch-above130.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Courses Beyond MA130 Functions">MA165 Calculus or a higher-level course</a>. Talk to your advisor and/or the mathematics program director to help you determine the right course for you. Credit for Advanced Placement exams will be considered once scores are received.</div>
