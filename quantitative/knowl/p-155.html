<div class="para">We appreciate your concern and recognize that choosing the right course may seem a daunting task. If the course you were initially directed to seems reasonable, we encourage you to sign up for that course. If it seemed too easy or too difficult, choose a course above or below it as appropriate. Courses recommended for Quantitative Majors in increasing order of difficulty are: <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a>, <a href="ch-CA.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA112 College Algebra">MA112 College Algebra</a>, <a href="ch-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA130 Functions">MA130 Functions</a>, or a <a href="ch-above130.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Courses Beyond MA130 Functions">course above MA130Â 5</a>. Perhaps, your skill set lies somewhere between two courses. How comfortable are you with tackling mathematical challenges and seeking help when needed? How much support have you relied on in previous courses? Note also that <a href="ch-MR.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: MA100 Math Refresher">MA100 Math Refresher</a> and <a href="ch-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA130 Functions">MA130 Functions</a> are only offered in fall semesters so you may want to take MA130 if you are mostly ready. It is easier to drop down to <a href="ch-CA.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: MA112 College Algebra">MA112 College Algebra</a> from <a href="ch-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: MA130 Functions">MA130 Functions</a> during the first week of class than the other way around.</div>
