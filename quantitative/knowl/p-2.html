<div class="para">As you were directed to this document, a course was probably recommended for you based on your degree program and your mathematical background.  If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to look at the description, learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for the recommended course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the recommended course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links or use the sidebar on the left to explore other options recommended for your major. If you were directed to this document via the Directed Self-Placement Survey, you should return to the survey after making your selection to record your decision and answer a few follow-up questions. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation and use this information to develop your schedule.</div>
